#### 2.0.1 (2023-07-12)

- toc updated for 10.1.5.

#### 2.0 (2023-05-13)

- Complete rewrite, with configurable quality levels. With a slash command you can now configure the qualities that should be equippable without confirmation:
  - Examples: `/aceq 0123`, `/aceq 02`, `/aceq 2`. For details, see description or in-game help text.
  - If `/aceq` conflicts with other addons, use `/autoconfirmequip`.
  - Type just `/aceq` or `/autoconfirmequip` to get in-game help on the configuration, including a quality index. It also displays the currently set quality levels.
  - The defaults are the same as with previous versions (Poor, Common, Uncommon), so if those are fine for you, you don't need to do anything.
- Added in-game icon.
- Updated readme/description.
